**Project Group Name:** Workout Effectiveness Prediction

**Names of Group Members:** Lizzy Partin

## Overview
This project analyzes which variables best predict a successful workout, using calories burned as the success metric. The dataset (from Kaggle) contains workout and personal fitness metrics, and the analysis focuses on HIIT and Cardio workouts.

## How to Run the Code
1. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (`Code.ipynb`).
2. Install required Python libraries:

   * pandas
   * numpy
   * matplotlib
   * seaborn
   * scikit-learn
3. Run all cells in sequential order.
4. Review the output visualizations and model results.

## Repository Structure
* `Code.ipynb` — Data cleaning, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
* `Final Report.pdf` — Full written report summarizing findings.
* `Presentation` — Powerpoint slides show that summarizes findings and methods. 
* `README.md` — Instructions and project overview.
* `planning.md` — Project discussion and planning document.

## Model Summary
* Logistic Regression model used to predict workout success.
* Strongest predictors: session duration, average BPM, male gender indicator.
* Weak/no impact predictors: age, fat percentage, weight, experience level.

## Group Member Contributions
* Lizzy Partin: I did everything as I am the only member. 

## Notes
This project could be expanded using additional datasets containing metrics like muscle mass, mental health, and stress levels.
